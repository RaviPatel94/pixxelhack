## 🐱 What is Cat Café?

PixxelHack is a **fun, minimal, and responsive cat café-themed website** built using **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**. The idea is to create a relaxing and modern web experience, inspired by the calm and friendly vibe of a real-world cat café.

It’s not just a website — it’s an experience:

- A welcoming **landing page** with soft visuals  
- A smooth **theme toggle** (light & dark)  
- A calming color palette and interactive layout  
- A visually rich **About Us** section highlighting the creators  
- Built for both desktop and mobile visitors

Whether you're a cat lover or a minimalist design enthusiast, PixxelHack gives you both: cuteness and clarity. 🐾
